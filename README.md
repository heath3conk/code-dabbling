## Steps for using exercism
1. Go to the website! You may have to switch to Allstate Guest to get here.
2. Click on the 'Languages' tab at the top of the page and choose Ruby.
3. Install Ruby - see menu on the left side of the page, then go to the 'Jumpstart Lab' setup instructions
    - Choose whichever type of computer you have from the options on the right side of the page
    - You can probably skip the Git installation for now. (What is git, you ask?) Ditto PostgreSQL.
