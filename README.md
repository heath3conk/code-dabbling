## Steps for using Exercism
1. Go to the [website](http://exercism.io/)! You will probably have to switch to Allstate Guest to get here.
2. Click on the 'Languages' tab at the top of the page and choose Ruby.
3. Install Ruby - see menu on the left side of the page, then go to the 'Jumpstart Lab' setup instructions
    - Choose whichever type of computer you have from the options on the right side of the page & follow the instructions
    - You can probably skip the PostgreSQL.
4. Get the Exercism [command-line client](http://exercism.io/clients/cli) so you can fetch exercises and submit them
5. Configure exercism so you can submit exercises: Go to [your API key](http://exercism.io/account/key) page (you have to have logged into exercism with GitHub to do this) and copy and paste the `exercism configure --key={yourAPIkey}` into your command line.
6. `exercism fetch ruby` And you're ready to go!
7. Open a text editor, like Atom, Sublime, or IntelliJ to run your code.
